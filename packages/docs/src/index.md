## Act-Master: A Library for Creating Extensible and Robust Frontend Applications

If you are looking for a library that simplifies the process of creating frontend applications and makes them more scalable and manageable, then Act-Master is the one you need. This library uses the best patterns to create extensible and robust frontend applications.

### What is Act-Master?

Act-Master is a JavaScript library that provides a simple and efficient way to develop frontend applications. It uses a combination of patterns such as commander and pub/sub to create an architecture that is easy to maintain, extend and test. Act-Master is designed to separate the business logic from the application itself, providing a clear separation of concerns that makes it easier to develop and maintain applications.

## Features of Act-Master

Act-Master has a number of features that make it stand out from other frontend libraries. Some of these features include:

### 1. Command Pattern

Act-Master uses the Command pattern to manage actions in the application. Commands are simple objects that encapsulate a piece of functionality, and they can be executed.
Commands provide a way to manage complex interactions in an application, making it easier to develop and maintain.

### 2. Pub/Sub Pattern

Act-Master uses the Pub/Sub pattern to manage communication between different parts of the application. Pub/Sub provides a way to decouple different parts of the application, making it easier to develop and maintain. With Pub/Sub, the application can react to events and changes without knowing where they come from, making it more scalable and flexible.

### 3. Separation of Concerns

Act-Master separates the business logic from the application itself, providing a clear separation of concerns. This makes it easier to develop and maintain applications, as the business logic can be changed without affecting the application itself. This also makes it easier to test the business logic independently from the application.

### 4. Extensibility

Act-Master is designed to be easily extended. It provides a simple and efficient way to create plugins that can be added to the application to extend its functionality. This makes it easier to add new features to the application without affecting the existing codebase.

## Advantages of using Act-Master

Act-Master has several advantages that make it a great choice for developing frontend applications. Some of these advantages include:

### 1. Easy to Learn

Act-Master is easy to learn and use. It provides a simple and intuitive API that makes it easy to develop applications using the library. The library is also well-documented, providing a clear and concise explanation of its features and how to use them.

### 2. Scalability

Act-Master provides a scalable architecture that makes it easy to develop and maintain large applications. The separation of concerns and decoupling provided by the Command and Pub/Sub patterns make it easier to manage complex interactions and changes in the application.

### 3. Testability

Act-Master makes it easy to test the business logic independently from the application. This makes it easier to write unit tests and integration tests for the application, ensuring that it works as expected.

### 4. Extensibility

Act-Master is designed to be easily extended. This makes it easy to add new features to the application without affecting the existing codebase. The library provides a simple and efficient way to create plugins that can be added to the application to extend its functionality.

## Getting started with Act-Master

Getting started with Act-Master is easy. The library can be installed using `npm` or `yarn`, and it can be included in your application using a script tag or module import. Once included, you can start

An example of a simple Vue 3 application can be [found here](https://github.com/avil13/vue-act-master/blob/master/packages/example/README.md).
