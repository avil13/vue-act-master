# Vue-Act-Master

## Motivation

Too often in the frontend there is a problem with separating the business logic.

This is a way to keep it separate from the view.

`Act-master` is a framework-independent library.

But all examples will be shown using its `vue-act-master` wrapper.


An example of a simple Vue 3 application can be [found here](https://github.com/avil13/vue-act-master/blob/master/packages/example/README.md).
